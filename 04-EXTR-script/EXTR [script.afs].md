## Extraction ##

1. In base folder, drop a copy of "20decodedglossary", extracted during a previous step.
2. Create a folder named "10rawscript" and extract all files from SCRIPT.AFS.  
**script.afs** entries are referenced internally by script call instructions (ExecScript, CallScript, etc.)
Order of items is important in script.afs, therefore a prepopulated `_filelist.txt` is provided (`_pctrial-DAT.txt`, `_ps2-DAT.txt`)

3. Place a copy of `_filelist.txt` into ".\10rawscript"
